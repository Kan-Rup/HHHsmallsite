	<h1>Various Interesting Ways to Interact with Poems.</h1>
	<br><br> 		
	<i><q class="postQuote"> You only read poems ? Consider, there may be other ways to work with a poem... </q><i>
	 	
	<br>
	
	<h2>Good day, Fine Person ...</h2>
	<p>
	In this listing, I have given a number of various ways a person could interact with poetry, 
	other than just reading a poem from a book. I think my favorite groupings might be : social ways, writing, creative and skillful ways.
	</p>

	<br><br>	
	
	<h2>Social</h2>
		
	<ul>
	<li>You can discuss poetry with friends, or in a discussion group.</li>
	<li>You can attend poetry reading events.</li>
	<li>You can use poetry within dramas and performances.</li>
	<li>How about dramatic performance and showing of a poem ?</li>
	<li>Sing-out, or artistically speak-out poems as part of a busking performance.</li>
	<li>Poetic improvisation events (improvise a poem or a song); call out – get response.</li>	
	</ul>
	
	<br><br>
	
	<h2>Writing</h2>	

	<ul>
	<li>Be a poet, write poetry yourself. Become better at it over time. </li>	
	<li>Keep a poetry related diary to journal thoughts.</li>
	<li>Imitate a good poem and write your own original, or a response.</li>
	<li>Creative commentary writing for a poem based on your personal experience.</li>
	<li>Illustrate poems with your own drawings and paintings.</li>
	<li>Writing of stories or a new work, based on memory of a poem as a key-stone.</li>
	</ul>	
	
	<br><br>
	
	<h2>Collections of Poems</h2>
	
	<ul>
	<li>Anthology book collection : a good addition to a personal book cupboard.</li>	
	<li>Personal poetry collection : a scrapbook, a written/illustrated book or an album of cards.</li>
	<li>Bedtime or morning reading and selected cards of poetry from album.</li>
	<li>Make a small jukebox of poetry recordings.</li>
	</ul>	
	
	<br><br>	
	
	<h2>Decoration</h2>
	
	<ul>
	<li>Framed poem sheets on the walls. With a picture to go along with it, you could remember the idea of the poem from sight of the frame/picture.</li>	
	<li>As chapter-start for writings. As start of a book, at the homepage of a website.</li>
	<li>Pair up a poem with an artwork.</li>
	</ul>
		
	<br><br>	
	
	<h2>Creative and Skillful</h2>	

	<ul>
	<li>Consider poetry based contemplation, meditation and visualization.</li>	
	<li>Read poetry out aloud, artistically.</li>
	<li>Mind-maps of poems.</li>
	<li>Memorizing poems and then recitation anytime suitable.</li>
	<li>Poetry reading made a part of lightweight rituals.</li>
	<li>Making of artwork to poetry.</li>
	<li>Making film or animation video for a poem.</li>
	<li>Make a small animatronic drama stage where a poem is recited and shown in scenery.</li>
	<li>Compose music accompaniment for reciting of poems’ parts and silence between parts.</li>
	<li>It might be possible to make use of poetry in an original card game, a board game, or a game book. </li>
	<li>Gentle artistic movements (like taichi or dance), keeping a poem in mind.</li>
	</ul>	
	
	<br><br>	
	
	<h2>Tech Stuff</h2>
	
	<ul>
	<li>Keeping a digital phone poetry collection, with groupings, random selections and prepared selections.</li>
	<li>Try any good poetry app.</li>
	<li>Visiting the poetry websites.</li>
	<li>Make a personal poetry video channel (e.g- youtube).</li>
	</ul>
		
	<br><br><br>

	<h2>So, that’s it...</h2>
	<p>
	I hope this list inspired you to find new ways to make a connection and interaction with a poem. 
	This sort of thing you would have to seek out, and make for yourself – since without your motivation and interest, 
	the relationship between the poet, poem and yourself may not come about.
