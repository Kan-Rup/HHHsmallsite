	<h1>An Article on Poetry : 11 Further Ways for a Deep and Absorbed Reading</h1>
	<br><br> 		
	<i><q class="postQuote">Read a poem, but read it well. We don’t do all these things step by step. 
	But to know its possible might show you the way at some time.</q><i>
	 	
	<br>
	
	<h2>Good day, fine person…</h2>
	<p>
	We have seen an example of how to read a poem. We did this with ‘Ozymandias’. 
	Now I go into some detail about each way of looking at the words of a poem. There are a number of major ways. 
	You can use all or fewer of them, in combination or sequentially.
	</p>

	<h3>Hey, listen…</h3>

	<br><br><br>

	<h3>Lightweight and Casual Reading</h3>
	<p>
	Simply to read casually and lightly, relaxed, and feeling alright in good posture and mood; 
	without many technical considerations.
	</p>
	
	<br><br>	
	
	<h3>Explorative Reading and Thought</h3>
	<p>
	Read the poem and explore the various ideas and themes further. 
	This can be done along narratives, and extension of patterns and implications, reasons, cause and effect. 
	Consider similar images and ideas, transmutations and variations. Think along context and background.
	</p>

	<br><br>

	<h3>Reading, Thought/feeling (etc), Waiting, in Cycles</h3>
	<p>
	Repeated reading, inner workings and waitings. Do this in cycles for a time in a relaxed manner. 
	What you repeat, you may remember more. So such material should mostly be neutral/positive (beauty/pleasure/agreeable/good/right).
	</p>

	<br><br>

	<h3>Holistic Reading</h3>
	<p>
	The other side of analytical reading. In this you read the whole work, and consider it from a viewpoint where you see the whole expression. 
	You try to hold a collective of ideas, themes and qualities in your mind and try to make sense of it.
	</p>
	<p>
	You may then go on to an analytical reading, and may consider doing another holistic reading afterward. 
	The first holistic reading mostly needs to get the key elements, aspects and structure; it can be more lightweight.
	</p>

	<br><br>

	<h3>Logical & Analytical, Parts Reading</h3>
	<p>
	This way is related to thought. Use of logic (narrow or broad) and reason. 
	Dividing the whole work into smaller parts in some sensible way, and examining the parts closely.
	</p>

	<br><br>

	<h3>Philosophical Reading, Contemplative Reading, Ideas and Thought</h3>
	<p>
	This is more to do with considering the widom within the words, seeing with wisdom within your mind, 
	and striving for clear and deeper understanding. To think, feel, see and process toward meaningful, valuable, and important ends, 
	knowing clear priorities.
	</p>

	<br><br>	
	
	<h3>Meditative Reading</h3>
	<p>
	To read a poem meditatively, “absorb in to” the poem with your attention, posture, and relaxation. 
	Focus attention for view to be broad and clear, on the key element you consider.
	</p>
	<p> 
	Sustain your attention and awareness, and try to understand the element considered in your mind.
	</p>
	<p> 
	There may be a number of features or aspects to such an element or image. You move from aspect to aspect, giving each enough time. 
	You cycle through them or move in sensible lines. <br>You may sound your impressions, thought / image springings, ideas, 
	in thought sayings or spoken murmurs.
	</p>

	<br><br>	

	<h3>Emotional Reading</h3>
	<p>	
	This is about reading with a focus of feelings and evoking own emotions in suitable or appropriate ways. 
	Aim for emotional experience, understanding, clarification, development and working-out of things.
	</p>
	<p> 
	Here we have to keep within limits and restraint. The poetic material may have emotional impact. 
	<br>If it is negative, it must not be disruptive to living well, stability, balance and wellbeing.
	Emotion could highly charge the mental imagery. It could make the mind’s processes or will impulsive, or activate in a strong way. 
	So be careful to use emotion moderately and mildly.
	</p>

	<h3>Imaginative Reading</h3>
	<p>
	Imaginative readings of literature are for those that can control and work their imaginations healthily. 
	(may mean you restrain yourself from unstable over-imagination,  keep imagination mild, neutral/positive, know when to cease daydreaming, 
	can keep from unintended imaginative flights etc).
	</p>
	<p>
	So in this way of reading, you use your skills of imagination. This can be done in two ways, active and passive.
	</p>
	<p> 
	Passive : read the poem and let your imagination form from it, without too much willful disturbance : 
	you are a mostly passive observer of arising images (careful to still have limits on negativity, unpleasant, bad things etc).
	</p>
	<p> 
	In active imagination you take an active part in your imaginative mental image formations. 
	You can make some willful choices and actions, changes. 
	</p>
	<p>	
	A part of the images formed depends on the poetry material read (so read good and benign poems), 
	and a part of images formed depends on your memory, mind and mental contents (possibly not all of it exactly “me”).
	</p>
	<p> 
	So you should not fully hard suppress, order, control all parts or process of the image formation, but still can have a clear say as “the ego” authority.
	</p>

	<br><br>	

	<h3>Reading and Memory</h3>
	<p>	
	Bring out mildly and controlled, your own knowledge and memories. Gently bring up accessible neutral/positive memories, compare and have thought.
	</p>
	<p> 
	If there are negative, painful or unpleasant memories relevant to the ideas of the poem, 
	take only the negative memories that are lightweight, small and easy to handle. Use this time to resolve them in your thoughts, feeling, imagination.
	</p>
	<p> 
	Heavier / more difficult negative memories / trauma or questions should be handled to resolve in a dedicated time, 
	when you have strength, intention and direction to specifically deal with it and heal it within you.
	</p>

	<br><br>	

	<h3>Synoptic reading, Linking Several Works into Groups</h3>
	<p>
	This is the reading of more than one works together. You can make comparisons, combinations, linking of elements and so forth.
	You would be able to see which works have similar themes and motifs, and how to link such works together.
	</p>
	<p>
	This may give you some unexpected or original insights which is not to be found in either one work.	
	Synoptic reading work should be done somewhat carefully with some added effort. Give the collective work effort some patience.
	</p>

	<br><br>	
	
	<h2>So, that’s it…</h2>
	<p>
	We looked at 11 ways to approach reading a poem in this article. You don’t necessarily have to use all or any of these methods. But they are options. 
	</p>
	<p>
	Generally, reading poetry can be just about reading without too many constraints. 
	Getting a clear idea of the wording, and trying to make a connection with the poet’s expression. 
	In this, you can experience the experience the poet is expressing. You can remain with it, and consider it.	
	</p>
