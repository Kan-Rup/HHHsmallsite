	<br><br>
	
	
	<p>
	Tired of big old fighting games and too much violence? Kick back and relax a bit with a calm farming-life video game.
	You play at your own pace.
	</p>

	<p>
	Well, it is mostly calm and cozy. As you go into the mines underground, you will be fighting creatures. 
	Some wild creatures are considered pest or threat, and there is fighting/killing there. 
	However, the game overall is not too intense and you can play at your own pace.
	</p>

	<br><br>

	<p>
	“Stardew Valley is an open-ended country-life RPG! You’ve inherited your grandfather’s old farm plot in Stardew Valley. 
	Armed with hand-me-down tools and a few coins, you set out to begin your new life. 
	Can you learn to live off the land and turn these overgrown fields into a thriving home? It won’t be easy.<br><br>
	Ever since Joja Corporation came to town, the old ways of life have all but disappeared. 
	The community center, once the town’s most vibrant hub of activity, now lies in shambles. 
	But the valley seems full of opportunity. With a little dedication, you might just be the one to restore Stardew Valley to greatness!”
 	</p>
 	<br><br>

	<p>
	Stardew valley was developed by one developer ‘concernedape’, 
	who was inspired by “Story of Seasons” video game series and also looked to make some improvements.
	</p>
	<p> 
	For a game developed by one person, it is of quite good quality and has a fair amount of content. 
	You can play single player and also co-op. 
 	</p>
		
	<br><br>
	
	<p>
	There are a number of quests that you can take part in, and you can also do some requests and errands for the people in town. 
	One main quest is about the “junimo” spirits. For them you find various collections of items, and receive some useful upgrades and repairs in return.
	</p>
	<p>
	There are many crops to plant, and you can strategize how to be most effective. 
	<br>E.g- You can plant quick/slow growing crops, flowers, plant trees. You can make use of fertilizer-for-quality and quick-grow fertilizer.
	</p>

	</div>
	
	<br><br>
	
	<p> 
	You can also raise animals. This depicts personal emotional connection between a single family business farmer and his animals under his care, rather than nasty factory farming conditions. 
	You feed and take care of the animals daily, and pet them to keep them happy.<br> 
	This will in turn produce a number of animal product items from them, at top quality. <br><br>
	There is no killing of animals in this game. I guess the ‘game farmers’ are the kind and morally choosy sort, 
	so I wish it could have been the same in real world farms. But I talk enough of that.
	</p>

	<p>
	There are building options, for your land, and you can buy upgrades from the carpenter. 
	There is a mine where you can fight monsters and mine metals for materials. It helps to mine metals as you can make auto watering machines. 
	This takes some of the watering workload off you.

	<h4>My take on the game ...</h4>

	<p>
	The 2D graphics are nice, and change with each season. I think the artwork and colour palette for each season is well chosen, 
	as I get impression of the energy of season from the art. My favorite colours of season are summer and autumn. <br>
	</p>
	<p> 
	The music is nice, and also changes depending on the season. Again, summer gives impression of heat and power, Autumn is quiet and so on. 
	The wizard tower, the mines, and the community-hall has its own music. My favorite music is the Autumn time.
	</p>

	<br><br>	

	<p>
	The characters’ form is done in pixel art. You get to see them walk around in game. When you talk to a character, 
	the chat bar shows a well drawn picture of each character’s face, which changes in expression depending on what is said.
	</p>
	<p> 
	The faces of people all look pretty. I’m not complaining, but its also a bit strange as they are mostly all beautiful faced (mostly, and its no big issue).
	The dialogue options and the chat-bar drawing is enough to give the impression of talking to a person.
	</p>
	<p>
	My favorite people are the smith guy, the homeless guy, the wizard, the barkeeper, the boy with the football, the fisherman, Shawn and the farm lady, and Pierre the shopkeeper.
	</p>
	
	<br><br>
	
	<p>
	I have played 1 year of game time. Each month, there are birthdays of people in town. You can give the people gifts, and special gifts for birthday. 
	There are also some special events each season, such as a flower dance and visiting of the glowing jellyfish, and the night market.
	</p>
	<p>
	I found the night market event, halloween and the jellyfish event, to be my favorite.
	</p>

	<p>
	They are once a year events, and helps to break up the constant work of keeping the farm business running. 
	It helped me play the game more relaxed and “being a part of the village”.<br> 
	You have to be careful not to miss the event, so keep an eye on the calendar and the farm work.
	</p>
	<p>
	It seems there are some yearly developments also, as a new character introduced himself to me after one year has gone by.
	</p>

	<p>
	What I liked most was the roleplaying as an independent farmer living out in a small shack house in the country and tending the land, 
	and using own energy and strength to live off the land, and prosper over time. I know the real deal can be much more difficult to handle.
	</p>
	<p>
	It felt nice to play being a part of the town and live from day to day, through the seasons and over the years. 
	</p>
	<p>
	I actually didn’t manage to get that many years in, because my computer system broke twice and I lost my save more than once.
	I was planning of playing a year at a time, and taking a long break (a month or two?) before continuing to the  next year. 
	This way the play time increases even more.
	</p>
	
	<br><br>
	
	<p>
	I had a good time with stardew valley game, and will continue to play it for some time more. It was a nice change from all the usual action and violence modern time games often are developed around. 
	<br>I recommend this game to young people and older people too.
