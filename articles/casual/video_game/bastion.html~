	<h1>Bastion : Pretty Top-down Action Video-Game - A Game with a Story Focus</h1>

	<br>	
	
	<p>This is a top down isometric action game. It has very nice artistic graphics, 
	and a nice set of quite upbeat soundtracks. The graphics are a kind of stylistic 2D, and is smooth, colourful and nice to look at.</p>
	<p>
	I guess it should be suitable for older kids and above. There is fighting, challenge and contest depicted; 
	there is not much blood-spilling shown. Fine long as player doesn’t think it is what fighting is really like 
	(because real fighting is more unpleasant and hurt to both sides).	
	</p>
	<p>
	The game is shown from the point of view of a story-teller – who is narrating as things happen on the screen. 
	Incidentally, it seems it was the same actor who played Horatio Nullbuilt in the Primordia game (possibly – so I heard).	
	</p>
	<p>
	You play as ‘the kid’, the character who wakes up after the events of a world calamity, and survives his way to a gathering safety place.  
	You and those who gather there build up a settlement and a living place.
	</p>
	
	<br>

	</div>	
	
	<p>
	The story of the game goes into the back story of the kid, and a girl that joins the bastion partway through. 
	There is also an ‘Ura clan’ boy who comes to stay at the bastion, also a major part of the story.  	
	</p>
	<p>
	The story goes into what happened at ‘the calamity’, and how they will build and survive with the other forces at work in the world.	
	</p>
	<p>
	You start at the bastion, and then can choose to the thrown/fly over to any available maps in the world, 
	where you come face to face with all kinds of challenges, opposition, fighting. You meet allies who follow you to the bastion from time to time.	
	</p>
	
	<br>
	
	<p>
	The bastion can be upgraded to hold a number of buildings.  
	There is a brewery to select perks and effects that happen while you are fighting (I quite liked the little designs of the bottles).	
	</p>
	<p>
	There is a smithy (select from a number of unique weapons). 
	As you get resource items, you can upgrade you equipment and select the way they are weighted and behave.	
	</p>
	<p>
	There is a memorial (‘achievements’ recording place), a temple (choose god-figure icons to take on extra challenges), and so on.	
	</p>

	<h4>My take on the game</h4>
	<p>
	I guess the main character comes across as admirable, as he ventures to all the places, defeats opponents, uses a lot of weapons
	and has big fighting skills. I found it amusing that the kid always falls flat on his face at the destination, after the "air current rides" 
	in the sky. He always gets up from falling flat on his face, too.
	</p>	
	<p>
	I think this game is aimed at kids, teens and young adults most. The pretty and colourful graphics show it. Most of main characters
	are also young. I liked 'the kid' (the white hair and hairstyle), 'the girl' and 'Ura boy', as well as the Grandpa Narrator.	
	</p>

	<p>If I remember, the girl also had a moving backstory (which you can discover by playing that challenge).</p>
	<p>The Ura boy has a large plotpoint in the story. Its a bit sad that things don't go smoothly between the Baston and the Ura.</p>
	<p>If I remember, that was because there was some history for the Ura Boy that put him at odds with 'Seilondia' nation and the 'mancers'.</p>
	<br><br>
	<p>
	The story also reveals later, history that makes me feel a bit put off by the Narrator-grandpa. He and some other 'mancer' scientists are
	supposedly responsible for the state of calamity that came on.  
	</p>
	<p>
	This 'calamity', in our world, I am thinking has connotations of maybe nuclear war or some other large-scale scientist-made destructive weapon. 
	As we know, the world is in fear and difficulty due to the knowledge discovery of the atom-bomb (or biological weapons),
	</p>
	<p>Where nuclear war could happen, 
	there is much destruction and hurt of the lands and people of factions each-other, and many nations, lands of the world.</p>

	<br><br>

	<p>
	There seemed to be a kind of allegorical East-West cultural aesthetic in the story and the look of the two factions. 
	However, it doesn't seem to be reflecting specific real cultures in a hard way. 
	</p>
	<p>
	This is seen between the culture and aesthetics/people of Seilondia (possibly “the west”) 
	and from the narrator’s point of view, the ‘troublesome’ Ura (seemingly with some aesthetics of “the East”/Chinease/Japanease). 
	</p>
	<p>
	I preferred going the route of choices by ‘the kid’ that resolves the conflict between the two peoples at least to some level. 
	That is the “forgiving and saving” option.	
	</p>
	<p>
	Not giving away too much, the forgive and save option hits me with emotional music and drama.	
	</p>	 

	<br><br>
	
	<p>The gameplay can be fast paced, but person at older-kid, teen or above age should manage fine with it. There is a fair amount of skill
	that can be practiced in the blocks, dodging, rolls and weapon uses.</p>
	<p>Combat and fighting is made interesting with weapon upgrade choices, temple and brewery selections.</p>
	
	<br><br>
	
	<p>The story of the game itself and the elder-man's narration is a special focus. 
	I thought that it was a decent story, with some emotional plotpoints. I remember the Ura invasion event with I guess a little sadness.</p>
	
	<p>
	There are two major endings. One seems to be a repeating ending and the other a final one. 
	After a while I replayed it again, to see both endings. 
	Bastion is a nice story game. I had a good time with it. You might like it, whether you are kid or adult.
