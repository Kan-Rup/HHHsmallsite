	<p>
	From the graphics this might seem like a platformer for kids, but actually its a somewhat subtle and difficult game, 
	suited for teens and adults. Take one wrong step and you might end up dead in some trap or at hands of an enemy.
	</p>	
	
	<p>
	You start at the surface of a desert and go into the mines, where you work your way downward into new surroundings. 
	At first is the mines, then there is underground jungle, and ice-caves and so forth. 
	</p>

	<p>
	You collect gold and money to buy equipment at each run, and these can be very useful. 
	by default you have a whip, some bombs and some rope. 
	Other items could be things such as climbing gloves, a compass, a gun, parachute etc.
	</p> 
 
 	<p>
	It seems the game was done with the theme of Indiana Jones – the guy has a hat, jacket and whip, 
	and there are places where you can steal a golden statue from a place and run away from a round boulder.
	</p>

	</div>	
	
	<br><br>	 
	 
	<p>
	There is also an altar to a black goddess/demoness where it is possible to sacrifice people for something. 
	Personally I preferred the kisses-1ups than death sacrifice. <br> 
	There are also slave markets. These things which also shows that this game is suited for adults.
	</p>	 
	 
	<p>
	The levels are made by procedural generation and are unique each time you go into the mines. 
	You can’t stay in the mines for too long, as a big ghost comes after you. <br> 
	In the mines are bats, spiders, snakes, skeletons, arrow traps and spike traps.
	</p>

	<p>
	A nice soundtrack is available for this game. I even bought it separately.
	</p>
	<p>
	There is a second game, spelunky 2. It also seems to be well received.
	</p>

	<h4>My take on the game</h4>

	<p>
	Spelunky had a cartoony look. It has not exactly gritty or heavy looking. So, not realistic. <br> 
	However I was not expecting realistic, and liked the look generally. Really, graphics seems to be sort of aimed at kids. 
	But the game quickly gets more difficult for small kids.
	</p>
	<p>	
	I remember that I have also played a free version of this game, which had pixel art graphics.
	</p>	
	<p>
	The soundtrack has groups of music for each region of the game. So the mines have their music, jungle has their own, ice caves their own etc. 
	I liked one or two of the saxaphone tracks quite a bit, one from the mines and other from ice-caves.
	</p>

	</div>
	
	<p>	
	The game has a lot of various creatures you have to fight or avoid. In addition there are many traps, such as the arrow trap of spike trap. 
	Your own actions can also be hazardous, such as jumping into an unknown depth, or setting off a bomb.
	</p>
	<p>
	You have to be prepared to replay again and again, as you die a lot!
	However this is not that tiresome, as you understand it is how the gameplay works.
	</p>
	<p>
	The fun of the game comes from being skillful and surviving through the levels. 
	You have to be smart at finding coins, gems and useful items. 
	You have a default inventory of climbing-rope, and bombs. These have to be used carefully. 
	</p>
	<p>
	In addition there is a woman in red who needs saving who gives you a 1up life at the end of level, if you rescue her.
	</p>
	
	<br><br>	 
	
	<p>
	Your running and jumping skills matter, as sometimes you have to jump through a space or a chasm, and sometimes you have to run away. 
	I found the big-spiders to be scary when they chase you in the mine, and my tactic is usually to avoid them or run away.
	</p>
	<p>
	The compass and climbing gloves are useful items. I once or twice manage to avoid the big rolling boulder and take the gold-idol figure. 
	But it needs some planning first.
	</p>
	<p>
	I have gotten as far as the ice caves when I last played it. But of course there is some more levels beyond that too.

	<h2>So, that’s it...</h2>
	<p>
	In this article, I reviewed the game Spelunky 1. It is a fun little game to test you videogame survival skills on. Also thematic
	of Indiana Jones.
	</p>

	<br><br>	 	
	
	<ul>
	<li>Graphics : Simple nice looking cartoon graphics.</li>
	<li>Music : Smooth and nice various music.</li>
	<li>Gameplay : Tricky and need to be skillful.</li>
	<li>Story : Simple game setup story.</li>
	<li>Moral/message : Not much moral message. Adventure and seeking fortune. Some depiction of difficult themes adults might pick up on.<br>
	These come down to player's own choices, but no telling whats right or wrong from developer.</li>
	</ul> 	
	<br>
	<p>
	Rating : > WOAH GAME < ( Good game ) <br>
	Repetitive re-playing might be frustrating for some. Difficulty can be tricky for younger people. <br> 
	Depictions of killing creatures, sacrifices and slaves etc exist. (not much discouraging of "bad" choices etc).
