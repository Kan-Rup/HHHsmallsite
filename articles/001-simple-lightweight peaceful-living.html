	<h1>Simple Lightweight Peaceful Living</h1>
	<br><br> 		
	<i><q class="postQuote"> A simple life is an easier and lighter life. </q><i>
	 	
	<br>
	<p>
	These are my thoughts on a simple life. But I might have written a bit more.
	</p>
	<br>
	<h3>Attend to your basic important needs</h3>
	<p>
	Healthy water, food and nutrition. Clean unpolluted air. Warmth levels. Shelter. Security & Safety. Health & Mental Health. 
	Privacy, some space. Control stimulation, noise - make them moderate, tolerable. Some human company.
	</p>

	<br><br>

	<h3>Wants and extra-desires</h3>
	<p>
	Reduce these with reason. Let go of trivial / frivolous desires. Small amount of reasonable, realistic, valuable wants may be positive.
	</p>
	<p> 
	Excess indulgence can be a weight or burden – something harder to maintain over a long time.
	</p>
	<p> 
	In attachment to excess desire, there is a quality of feeling unfulfilled, unsatisfied. 
	A strong desire response tends to obscure the mind, from clear sight and right knowing. A sort of ‘glammer’.
	</p>
	<p>
	(In Buddhist terms) to be careful with both “sign of the beauty” and “sign of the ugly”. 
	It is better to not be attracted or repelled, without control and freedom of choice.
	</p>
	<p> 
	With objects, to pay wise attention. Being careful of such signs, to see the true nature of object.
	</p>

	<br><br>

	<h3>House, living space, bedrooms, living rooms</h3>
	<p>Minimalism and clarity is good especially for the bedroom and work-spaces.</p> 
	<p>
	Sometimes we clutter our spaces with items that don’t serve a clear function or have much importance. Such clutter should be much reduced. 
	Its good to have a clean storeroom to place any extra items. We also have to consider the ease of dusting and cleaning our spaces.
	</p>

	<br><br>

	<h3>Your location</h3>
	<p>
	Your living location should be useful and easy to your important needs. It might satisfy some mental comfort - such as being close to a park. 
	Each place we live in has positives and negatives.
	</p>
	<p> 
	Keep your location options open. Consider being closer to safe “nature” / countryside than hectic crowded urban spaces. 
	</p>

	<br><br>

	<h3>Family and Friends</h3>
	<p>
	Keep contact with good family & friends. Give extra consideration for close family & your deep friendships. 
	Keep best contact with those that are a support to you. Maintain contact where your relationship is meaningful, valuable and positive, in both directions.
	</p>
	<p>
	It is upto you, but from time to time you may want to do a reality check. 
	Which of your friends and relations are too toxic, not-honest, not much meaning or value. Which are misleading to a good, moral life.
	</p>

	<br><br>

	<h3>Travel</h3>
	<p>
	Travel with good reason and get most true value and worth out of it. Reduce frivolous trivial or excess traveling. Keep it at a balance.
	</p>
	<p> 
	Some worthy safe travel in life, can add value to it.
	</p>

	<br><br>

	<h3>Leisure, Entertainment, Hobbies</h3>
	<p>Consider minimizing that which is low-value and high-risk, high-cost, or toxic.</p>
	<p>
	Some hobbies give something positive in mental and brain development. 
	These are such things as play, reading, art, craft, music, dance, yoga, tai-chi, low/moderate risk sport.
	</p>
	<p>
	You can have a variety of hobbies. But you don’t have to try doing everything at the same time. 
	Stack some of the time into practice in a smaller set of concentrated hobbies.
	</p>
	<p> 
	Put the other time into rest, relaxation. To  “just-being-well” (being.) and  lightweight or deep meditation. 
	Deep medication is a valuable, somewhat serious undertaking, and also have to be a bit careful.
	</p>
	<p>
	You could take time to maintain your mental health (physical / social too if needed). 
	Make healthy decisions about taking control of your screen-time and social media use. 
	Social media without can make us addicted to scrolling, media consumption and so on. 
	</p>
	<p>
	Social media, software (such as video games) needs well being-options built into them. 
	</p>
	
	<br><br>	
	
	<h3>The Material and Spiritual</h3>
	<p>
	My view is, it is best to make a balance between materialism and “the spiritual”.
	</p>
	<p> 
	We need attention to material, in life to maintain the basic necessities and to be healthy in body and mind. 
	Maintenance of the body is a need. Body-weight needs to be balanced in life. Other than that, we mostly need the cleanliness, washing and grooming.
	</p>
	<p>
	Interest in Spirituality starts with researching and understanding what “spirituality” actually is. The mind is hindered without a clear idea of this.
	</p>
	<p> 
	We need attention to this area, to prepare for a meaningful life. To come close to understanding death or existential dilemmas. 
	To understand how to deal with hardships, traumatic experiences. How to handle experiences of pain/aversion and pleasure/attraction.
	</p>
	<p>
	It also is a part in understanding of reality and truth, purpose and meaning, value and worth. 
	In living a mortal life half in uncertainty, but still grasping some certain truth.
	</p>
	<p> 
	We need spirituality for the mind to to find ways to purify itself and cleanse itself.
	</p>

	<br><br>

	<h3>Your income and work</h3>
	<p>
	This depends on your choices of functioning in society. In modern times this is mostly which kind of employment, career, job you work at. 
	A matter of earning money.
	</p>
	<p>
	If there is an alternative, a person does not have to take on an overpowering stressful work life, or burnout. 
	It is a matter of your personal strength, stamina, endurance and health. Your stress and anxiety tolerance levels also matter.
	</p>
	<p>
	Usually where possible, making of a moral and virtuous choice on work or career is good.
	</p>
	<p>
	There is the option of self-employment and setting up of a personal small business. This is not the easy option. 
	There is some risk and luck involved, need for funds, and a larger amount of  active work to be done over a long time.
	</p>
	<p>
	But you might consider that as a path to greater freedom. Be careful, practical and sure about those choices.
	These are your careful choice to make.  
	</p>
	
	<br><br>

	<p>
	Also a thing to keep in mind is the kind of work-survival that is not involved in making of money. In this, there is direct effort-to-reward connection.
	</p>
	<ul>
   <li>
   Present and past cultures with hunter-gatherer tribes. I do not approve of hunting unless by dire necessity. 
   But gathering, foraging of plant material, fruits, flowers, nuts, berries is an option.
   </li>
   <li>Subsistence agriculture, ( farming for own use ) is another method. This could be of fruits, vegetables, herbs, and other materials.</li>
   <li>DIY making of things such as shelter, tools and energy-generation does not need money.</li>
   <li>Given community labor can also provide housing, security and food as a reward in exchange.</li>
   <li>Bartering and mutual-aid methods can also be used to avoid money use.</li>
   <li>Spiritual effort and services to the community can be a way of taking donations such as food. (e.g- This is seen with the Buddhist bhikku).</li>
   </ul>
   <p>
	These ways of earning and working are more resistant to economic downturns. 
	It is resistant to inflation, employment control, global supply chain issues, disasters. 
	There is a better community togetherness, and you gain valuable practical skills.
	</p>
	
	<br><br>

	<h3>End of life goals</h3>
	<p>
	Keep your end-of-life goals in mind. Have a plan for difficult situations, accidents and emergencies.
	</p>
	<p> 
	Since we all face illness, aging and dying, its well to have a plan of how these are carried out well. 
	How you will be ready for these major changes and challenges in life.
	</p> 
	<p>
	We may need some spiritual experience and thought to come to terms with these things. 
	To come to right attitudes of dealing with these challenges in healthy, right and moral ways.
	</p>
	<p>
	Good daily lifestyle, being satisfied with life, can help. Insight and understanding into nature of your self, your being, your body and mind helps. 
	A far enough understanding of nature of the world helps. Preparation : charity, good deeds, deep skillful contemplation, meditation and so on.
	</p>

	<br><br>
	
	<h2>So, that’s it...</h2>
	<p>
	I've written here some thoughts on living a simple and lightweight life. I assume there may be some more things to say.
	</p>	
	<p>
	Summarizing, it is about being minimalist, fulfilling needs well. It is about reducing unnecessary desires and being clutter free. 
	It can also be about making good choices about the family, friends and work. About maintaining your health.
	</p>
	<p>
	Also simplicity and lightness can also be in the mentality and mindset.
	</p>
	<p>
 	A person has to have a lighter of the mind, be satisfied, and somewhat happy at least. A person having a simple day, not stressed by many things. 
	</p>
	<p>
	A person has to have has manageable responsibilities. Such must be ready to relax, rest and just be well when the right time comes. 
	Person need have some spiritual understanding and good view of things.
	</p>
	<p>
	Such have an easier time with a simpler lightweight life. 	
	The trick is to get to that kind of mentality, in the right ways.
	</p>
