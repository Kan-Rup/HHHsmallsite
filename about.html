      <h1> About </h1>
    	
    	<div id="upperRow">
    	
    	<div id="upperLeft" class="upperText">
		<p> 
			I'm Kanishka K Rupasinghe. I go by the name label "Autumn-MistHare" on this site and my content channels.
			I first lived in Sri Lanka. In teens I moved with my family to England, Uk. After school, there I got a
			(2.1 Bsc Computer Science Hons) degree from Luton UoB campus. 
		</p>
		<p>
			During those years I got Schizophrenia condition/psychosis. I was later admitted to hospital/mental health ward. 
			It was hurting, difficult and still exists, but a chemical medication dose keeps things manageable for me.
			I decided I have to take the help of chemical-pill to stay well and without troubles, until a better treatment/cure is found.  
		</p>
		<p>
			Work, employment was difficult at times, and sporadic. I did volunteer quite a bit in the Leicester area, such as at
			charity shops, Leicester Citizen's Advice, Leicester Libraries & Museums, and Leicester War Memorials. Also worked at
			Leicester General Hospital, in a day-clinic as HCA. 		
		</p>
		<p>    
			I had to come back to live in Sri Lanka with family (coronavirus pandemic times). I now live in the region I grew up in (Kandy area).
		</p>
		<p>
			I decided to invest my time into self-employment, business, social media content and blogging. This way there is a possibility for
			me to build life earnings without engaging directly in the employment-work-jobseeking competition. It is a way of trying to balance hard 
			mental health difficulties with a necessary survival effort. I am dependent on my family during this time and have less freedom.
		</p>    
		<p>
			If things go well in this effort, I can build earnings and savings, and move to a better living place. So I ask you that if you are
			interested in my work and see that my work has quality, please follow my work and support in whatever way you can.
			Competition and difficulties still exist in the area of business I work in.

		<h3>Casual Articles</h3>    
		<p>
			In addition to the main original work, I write some topics more causally. These could include articles on fiction books, movies and shows, 
			video-games, Tv, tech related content, interesting internet sites, valuable or important social media, poetry, short stories, 
			literature and so on. These works I write to a standard but take in a causal and lightweight manner.  		
		</p>
		
		<br>		
		
		<h3> The blended-in Niches </h3>
		<p>I write from these topic areas, to spice things up and keep it interesting, or combine these with my main niche area. </p>
		<ul>
			<li><b>Music and Art</b></li>
			<p>Both areas I have interest in, and some production involvement. These works can also give sense of beauty to people.</p>
			
			<li><b>Entertainment, Drama & Conflict</b></li>
			<p>Mostly will be seen in the casual section. I might write more if I really care about it.</p>
			
			<li><b>Stories & Narratives, Fiction books - Science Fiction & Fantasy</b></li>
			<p>I read in fantasy works, science-fiction, young-ones books. </p>
			
			<li><b>Archaeology, Deep-time, Paleontology, Past cultures/Civs, Folklore, Folk song/music, Legends and myths, History</b></li>
			<p>Like Lucas' Indiana Jones, I just have a bit of an interest in these past realities. And of meaning for now and future.
			</p>			
			
			<li><b>Happiness, Love (am no expert) & (esp) Friendships, Healthy Solitude, Sense of love and belonging in Solitude</b></li>
			<p>Things everyone needs one way or other. Also about finding fulfillment without over-attachment to materialism.</p>			
			
			<li><b>Health & Wellness, Lifestyle & Self-Improvement, Motivation & Success</b></li>
			<p>Important things we all need to be well, strong and satisfied.</p>
			
			<li><b>Ethical-moral Work, Finance & Wealth</b></li>
			<p>Don't expect much from me on this. In this world someone fills the gap to do the bad work in the end. But I hope I can say something. </p>
			
			<li><b>(a small selected amount of) Mystery, Life, Light & Darkness</b></li>
			<p> Mysteries are mysteries - there are a relevant few. "Darkness" I talk about a little, carefully as I can. </p>
			
			<li><b>Tech, Coding & Gadgets</b></li>
			<p>This is a part of my study knowledge, though its a bit rough for me to work in this area now.</p>
		</ul>
		
		<br>		
        
		<h3>Main Content Topics</h3>
		
		<p>
			I intend to make content on following topics and subtopics. The first area is to do with "mental skill & ability". Under this are
			topics such as meditation techniques; "mentat" (intellectual) methods ; memory techniques; keeping stability,
			health and safety along with use of mental techniques; and so on.   
		</p>      
		<p>
			An area of content to do with "wisdom & understanding" : life, death and problems to do with life, the sense of self, "soul" and no-soul;
			mental clarity and rightness, nature, reality and so on.
		</p>
      <p>
			An area of topics to do with the mind and functions of the mind. Selected schools of psychology; consciousness, the mind's language; mental 
			faculties; dreams, active imagination, and so on.      
      </p>
		<p>
			An important area of mental health and wellbeing. I make it known to you that I have significant mental health challenges, and in my own
			way I am dealing with maintaining a level of possible mental health.	Topics such as major problems; therapy; habits and the mind;
			mind-body connection; ways of non-chemical medication treatment; and so on. 	
		</p>      
		<p>
			I write about some teachings of some cultural closeness to me : Buddhism, Daoism, Yoga. I discuss some major groups of people or "roles"
			in society (history to present) to do with mind and wellness. Such as the Buddhist monks, the greek philosophers, The yogis, the shaman 
			role, chinease teachers of qigong/tai-chi. 
		</p>
      
      <br>
      
      <h3>Other Minor Interests</h3>
		<p>Animals and creatures, Nature, (natural sciences : Geology, Weather, Climate, Sea studies) Philosophy and observations, Clear Animism, Culture,
		Science & Technology.
